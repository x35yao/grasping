1. Mesh of the objects made in Matlab(obj. files are downloaded from ycb website), the positions of the gripper are plotted as well.
2. {}_gripper_wrt_object was generated in such a way that the offset between object mesh and the coordinate origin is compensated.
3. {}_gripper_wrt_object is generated in directory "data_collection"

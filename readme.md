# Data collection 

First we collected data for 4 objects which then are used to calculate the object_coordinates_wrt_table and  gipper_coordinates_wrt_object.
# Mesh in matlab 

The gipper_coordinates_wrt_object data are then used to plot the mesh in Matlab to visualize the gripper position and orientation wrt objects.
# Depth map 

The gipper_coordinates_wrt_object data are then used to generate coordinates of rays which then are used to generate the depth maps.
# Grasp orientation 
Tis seperated from what is done above. It analyzes the orientation of the grasps.
# Achive

All the old and messy code is in grasping_archive.zip.(Don't do it like this anymore!)

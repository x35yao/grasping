# Data collection 
We collected data for 4 objects(softscrub, foambrick, sugerbox and mustard) which then are used to calculate the object_coordinates_wrt_table and  gipper_coordinates_wrt_object.
# Mesh in Matlab 
The gipper_coordinates_wrt_object data are then used to plot the mesh in Matlab to visualize the gripper position and orientation wrt objects.
# Depth map 
The gipper_coordinates_wrt_object data are then used to generate coordinates of rays which then are used to generate the depth maps.
# Grasp orientation 
This is seperated from what is done above. It analyzes the orientation of the grasps.
# Achive
All the old and messy code is in grasping_archive.zip which is too big to be here.(Don't do it like this anymore!)
